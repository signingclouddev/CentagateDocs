# ðŸ”—Bind Token

### Token

To bind a token to a user, you must know that there are 2 types of Tokens generally in CENTAGATE.
There are:
- **OTP Token**.
- **SMS Token**.

### ðŸ¤”What is OTP Token?

OTP is stand for ***One-Time-Password***, which means you may use the token only once after itâ€™s been generated, and it is generated based on current time and a secret key. 
In CENTAGATE, there are **2 type of OTP tokens**.

There are: 

âœ“ **Hardware Token**  
âœ“ **Soft Token**
Under Soft Token, there are **2 types of Soft Token**, which is: 
- **Time-Based (TOTP)**
- **Challenge Response (CROTP)**

### ðŸ¤”What is Hardware Token?

A hardware token is a device, typically provided by companies like **Feitian**, used for authentication. 
It generates secure codes for login, adding an extra layer of security to systems or networks. 
Users need to use the generated code to authenticate. These tokens are physical and often come in forms like small device.

### ðŸ¤”What is Soft Token?

Soft token also known as a software token or virtual token, is a type of security credential used in authentication systems. Instead of being a physical device like a hardware token, a soft token is typically a software application that generates one-time passwords for authentication. To install soft token, user need to import the soft token seed file to CENTAGATE for allowing immediate use.

Remember there are 2 types of soft tokens? So here is the explanation.

There are:
- **Time-Based (TOTP)**  
Time-Based One Time Password is a temporary one-time-password being generated for user to authenticate based on the current time and secret key.

- **Challenge Response (CROTP)**  
Challenge-Response One Time Password is an authentication that involves a challenge being issued by CENTAGATE to the user, who then provides a response based on a generated code shared between the user and CENTAGATE.
