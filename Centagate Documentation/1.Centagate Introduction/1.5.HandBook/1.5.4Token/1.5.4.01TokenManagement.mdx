# 🪙Token Management

### 🪄Prelude 
Administrators wield extensive control over token management, with the ability to **ADD and IMPORT tokens, UPDATE details, and DELETE tokens as needed**. 
This comprehensive authority extends to direct oversight of tokens under individual user accounts, allowing for personalized and granular management. 
Notably, administrators possess the unique capability to activate tokens for users without undergoing the usual validation process, facilitating swift and secure user onboarding.
