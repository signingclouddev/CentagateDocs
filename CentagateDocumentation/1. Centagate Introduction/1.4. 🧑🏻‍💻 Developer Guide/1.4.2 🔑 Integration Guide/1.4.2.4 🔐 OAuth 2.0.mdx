# üîê OAuth 2.0

### ü§î What is OAuth 2.0?

> "OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework used to grant third-party applications limited access to a user's resources without revealing their credentials. It involves four main entities: the client application, the resource owner (user), the authorization server, and the resource server. The process includes the client requesting authorization, the user granting permission, the exchange of authorization grant for an access token, and the use of this token by the client to access resources on the resource server. OAuth 2.0 provides a standardized and secure way for users to share their data across different platforms without compromising their credentials."
