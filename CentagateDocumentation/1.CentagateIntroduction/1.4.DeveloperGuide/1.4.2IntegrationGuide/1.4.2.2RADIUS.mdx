# üì∂ RADIUS

### ü§î What is RADIUS?

> "RADIUS, which stands for ***Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service***, is a networking protocol that provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) management for users who connect and use a network service. In integration, RADIUS is commonly used to authenticate and authorize users accessing network resources, such as Wi-Fi, VPNs, or network devices like routers and switches. It allows organizations to manage user access efficiently by centralizing authentication processes, ensuring security, and facilitating accounting for network usage. "
