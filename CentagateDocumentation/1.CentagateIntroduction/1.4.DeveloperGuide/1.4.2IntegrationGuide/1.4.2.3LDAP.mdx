### ü§î What is LDAP?

> "LDAP ***(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)*** is a standard application protocol used in IT for accessing and managing distributed directory information services. It provides a lightweight and efficient means of organizing and querying data in a hierarchical structure. LDAP is commonly utilized for centralized authentication, authorization, and directory services in network environments. It operates over TCP/IP, with operations defined in the LDAP protocol for querying, modifying, adding, and deleting directory information. LDAP is implemented in various directory server software, such as OpenLDAP and Microsoft Active Directory, and it plays a crucial role in managing user identities and access control within enterprise systems."
